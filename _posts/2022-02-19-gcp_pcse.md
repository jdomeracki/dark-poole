## **Preface**
Let me begin by stating that I want to keep it real by not inflating the meaning of earning this or any other certification.\
Having said that I do believe that the preparation for this exam can amplify the learning process and spare you the trial and error route.\
Passing this exam won't automatically make you a great Cloud Security Engineer but it will help facilitate a common language and a strong intuition on how Google approaches security.
## **Prerequisites**
There are no prerequisites to taking this exam. In terms of the skills and knowledge baseline that one should poses Google offers a rather vague advice. 
> Recommended experience: 3+ years of industry experience including more than 1 year designing and managing solutions using Google Cloud.

Listed below is a set of arbitrary hints that I think might be helpful in determining whether this exam won't be too much of a hassle at given point in your journey.

**Cryptography:** I think that a good rule of thumb to assess if you won't struggle with this section is to perform a little exercise. \
If you're able to explain what's the purpose of each or most parameters used in a TLS 1.2 cipher suite then I think you're good to go.

`Example: TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`

**Networking:** Let me first that assure you won't need a subnetting calculator when preparing for this exam. \
 Having said that Networking is a big part of the curriculum. You'll need to understand the difference between *private vs public ranges*, how CIDR works and what is achieved by using the NAT mechanism just to name a few.

**IAM:** Least privilege in all shapes and forms. Understand the resource hierarchy and inheritence.

**Application Security:** No practical ability to execute any kind of attacks/techniques will be required of you. \
 In general a basic understanding of Layer 7 vulnerabilitity classes covered in OWASP TOP 10 should suffice.

**Cloud-Native (GKE & Serverless):** If it weren't for the exam guide I would say spend the bulk of your time learning all there is about securing containerized workloads. But in reality it won't help you much in passing the examâ€Š-â€Šmore on that later.

## **Prep**
I created a [repository](https://github.com/jdomeracki/GCP-PCSE) on GitHub that contains all the resources that I found valuable and used for my own studies so I'll keep this part brief.
In general I recommend to pick one interactive course to get started ([Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-cloud-security) would be my top pick followed by [A Cloud Guru](https://acloudguru.com/course/google-cloud-certified-professional-clou%5Cd-security-engineer). Then I would focus mostly on going through the docs and taking practice exams.
If I were to pick one resource that I found particularly useful then that would be the recently updated [Prep Notes](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/google-cloud-professional-security-exam-prep-sheet-ammett-williams/?published=t) by [Ammett Williams](https://twitter.com/ammettw).
## **Exam experience**
I had to wait an hour for the proctor to show up so there's that ðŸ™ƒ

The test was of good quality. Some of the scenario-based questions were quite tricky and I must admit that on few occasions I relied on an educated intuition. Overall I would rate the difficulty as a 7/10.
What I find surprising is the apparent neglect of GKE in the syllabus and the exam itself. I suppose that this is a conscious decision but I'd be curious to know why that is. From what I recall basic GKE knowledge was required for the ACE certification. Based on the exam guide alone it seems that the [Professional Cloud DevOps Engineer](https://cloud.google.com/certification/guides/cloud-devops-engineer) might cover it to some extent as well.
## **Final thoughts**
In retrospect preparing for this certification and taking the exam was definetly worth it.
